SLIDESHOW

For the HTML part, the main container had multiple div elements with each one reperesenting
slides in my slideshow, there is a total of 8. Each slide includes a div with the class 'numbertext',
this displays the number of the slide and an 'img' element to display the image.
The 'prev' and 'next' navigation is set up. 

For JavaScript, 'slideIndex' keeps track of the current slide displayed, which is inititally set to 1.
'showSlides(n)' function manages the slide visibility, hides it according and displays the one with the 
index set by 'n'. 
'plusSlides(n)' function increments or decrements the index.

One of the challenges I faced was moving from the last slide to the first, I implemented conditional checking
in the 'plusSlides(n)' function and thus, if the user goes past the last slide, the index is again set to 1 (first slide),
and if the user goes before the first slide, the index is set to the last.

FORM

For the HTML part, I created a form with fields for Username, Email, Password and Confirm Password. Each field
has a placeholder for error messages having a class of '.error'. 

For real-time validation, I used JavaScript. Prevented form submittion unless validation criteria is met. Error messages are displayed below the respective input fields.
Success indicators are applied when the input is correct. Error indicators and error messages are shown when the input is incorrect.

I successfully integrated the registration form into a pop-up modal that is triggered when the user clicks the "Contact Us Now" button in the call-to-action section.

It was a challenge to integrate the modal. Ensured it's triggered when "Contact Us" button is clicked and closes when clicked outside.
